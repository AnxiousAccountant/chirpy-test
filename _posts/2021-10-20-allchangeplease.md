Last week it was announced by my manager that I would be leaving Zurich after 14 years of working here. This was only the second time in my life I have handed my resignation in to a manager if you don't include leaving my Saturday job at Sainsburys which I can't remember how I did that with it being such a long time ago!

Now I have changed a lot over the past 14 and not only my physical appearance as seen from my two staff ID badges, the second one was made around the time of my post on LinkedIn in 2019 (which you can see below on my blog post) where I started a journey towards become a new me, I am still on that journey and if the last 3 and a bit years and the current pandemic have taught me anything it's that life is too short not to take new opportunities if they come along even if you are going into the unknown (now I have the song from Frozen 2 in my head ah ah, oh oh!).

        <p>2018 was a difficult year for me (and those close to me), I didn't want to dwell on that too much but if it has taught me one thing it is I will never suffer in silence anymore and thought if anyone out there is reading this and suffering with a mental illness I hope they can learn from my experiences.</p>

So 14 years is a long time and interestingly a couple of months after I started at Zurich the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7085643.stm">iPhone was released in the UK</a> and for those of you who know me I have never owned one and that's something that will never change and too be honest the iPhone hasn't changed much over the years either has it? Unlike me!

I will miss working at Zurich but one thing I haven't come to terms with is having to hand back my company car which was my first step into the world of electric after having to wait so long to receive it due to Covid and Brexit delays...
<p></p>
But in all seriousness how do you sum up 14 years of your career: well being an accountant there is only one way to do that and it's a spreadsheet...
