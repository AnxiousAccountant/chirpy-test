paragraph1: So after my first try of non alcoholic beer in 2007 it took 12 years for me to find a beer worthy of a full 10/10. I spotted it on a random trip to Tesco and even though it was more expensive than any of the previous 30+ beers, I had to give it a try.
paragraph2: Now I always liked a bottle of Peroni when in an Italian restaurant and the non-alcoholic lived up to the "good" old days.
paragraph3: There is no downside to this beer for me as it isn't overly carbonated, it has a nice light fruity taste and only a small about of bitterness coming through at the end. A really refreshing and easy to drink beer which is worth the premium price.
