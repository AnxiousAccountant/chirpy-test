paragraph1: A one night stopover on a road trip to centre parcs in holland meant I got to try my first taste of a Belgium beer however even though it was called Jupiler N.A it actually had 0.5% ABV which I didn't realise this until I had finished!
paragraph2: Now this was a pale lager but had a sweeter taste than I was used to back then and would have been one to add to my list to try again if not for the 0.5% ABV, which is probably why the brewery replaced it with Juplier 0.0% in 2016.
