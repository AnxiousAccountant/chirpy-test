<h2 style="display: none;"> My Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey</h2>
![Beer](/assets/img/beer.jpg){: width="180" .left}

In November 2010 I had my last alcoholic drink and in the last 10+ years the world of non-alcoholic beers has come on leaps and bounds.

So here is a story of my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey as I have taken at least one picture of every beer (50 at time of writing) I have had over the years, but have 100s of pictures in my non alcoholic beer album on google photos and the most photographed beer in my collection is Heineken Zero.

With most of the beers there is a story, others only worthy of a couple of lines but each given a score out of 10 and as I try new ones they will be added to the list and from 2021 onwards I will be reviewing them as close to trying as possible

<h2 style="display: none;"> Techniques for non-alcoholic beers</h2>
Interestingly I have learnt a little about how non alcoholic beers are made in most cases the beer is brewed normally and then the alcohol is taken out but most breweries keep their exact technique secret, but below are the 4 most common techniques to produce a non-alcoholic beer which is defined as having 0.5% ABV or less are:

<h3 style="display: none;"> Reverse osmosis</h3>

1. Reverse osmosis: is a water purification process that uses a partially permeable membrane to separate ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles in the case of beer the alcohol and water is removed, leaving a concentrated version of the beer, the water is then added back without the alcohol.

2. Limited Fermentation: alcohol in beer is produced during fermentation, when yeast breaks down the sugar, this can be done in a variety of different ways
Limiting Fermentable Sugars: Using grains that produce less fermentable sugars or techniques that limit the sugars from the grains in the mashing process.
Special Yeast Strains: Some yeast strains will naturally produce less alcohol on fermentation but this may leave you more sugars in the final beer or other leave the beer with a sour taste.
Blocking Fermentation: By changing the environment (eg temperature, acidity) during fermentation can either stop or slow down the process leaving less alcohol but you may be left with a sweeter or "unfinished" tasting beer.

3. Watering Down: So rather than removing the alcohol you dilute the finished beer with water, with this process you need to make a concentrate beer first.

4. Avoid Fermentation: By not fermenting the beer you avoid creating the alcohol but you also avoid doing what makes a beer a beer but producers tweak the production process to create a drink that looks and tastes like a beer.

Below is a link to more details on each of the beers I have tried. (I can't confirm for definite that I have tried a beer from each of the 4 techniques above but I know for definite I have tried a reverse osmosis and avoid fermentation)
