paragraph1: My first non-alcoholic beer was actually before I actually stopped drinking alcohol when I was given a Becks Blue instead of a normal Becks, we only noticed when someone asked us why we were drinking Becks Blue, not realising at the time that this would be the only non-alcoholic beer I could get in most pubs for a number of years and it is still accounts for a large proportion of the UK non-alcoholic beers sales.
paragraph2: The one in the picture was with a custard tart which I probably had to counter the bitterness, but I have not had a Becks Blue for a few years and the last one pictured on my phone was from before I moved to my current house which was 4 years ago, but as it was one of the first on the blocks it will always have a place in my heart but no longer in my stomach!
