paragraph1: So a this beer is bottled in France for Sainsbury's and I like it when a bottle is 500ml as its nearly a pint!
paragraph2: This one pourded and looked like a pilsner, with a fair amount of bubbles. The taste did remind me of other pilsners I had tried.
paragraph3: It was slightly gassy to start but a nice clean crisp tasting beer which I enjoyed and will definitely have again
