paragraph1: So we arrived in Centre Parcs in America, Netherlands after our stop over in Belgium, and with dinner I got to try my first radler which seems very popular in Netherlands. This was a non-alcoholic wheat beer with sparkling lemon with a refreshing taste and slightly nicer than the San Miguel Manzana I had tried in Ibiza.
paragraph2: This beer also reminded me of being a kid where I was allowed to often have a can of lemon larger shandy from the COOP near my doctors. This was again a nice taste but could get a similar and cheaper taste from a fanta lemon, but it wouldn't be my last radler that day!
