paragraph1: So 2013 delivered another new beer this time from a shop, I can't remember which one but my first taste of this was on a nice summer's day picnic. This one has a sweeter taste than the other two I had tried but became a good replacement to Becks Blue at the time. The last time I had this one was 2016 and haven't seen it around recently.
