paragraph1: Clean, crisp and sessionable was the claim on the bottle and after the pour which looked clean with a light head. The first taste was clean and crisp. And a hint of malt citrus aftertaste.
paragraph2: After looking up Sessionable on google. {Adjective INFORMAL (of beer) relatively low in alcohol content and therefore suitable for drinking over an extended period}. After the first bottle I think this one could be good for a few in a session unlike some of the beers in the list that leave me bloated after just one or two.
paragraph3: I have the Days Pale Ale to try next but this one makes it into the top 10 on my list at the time of writing. I am pleased I have some more in my beer cupboard to have at a later date, maybe a session rather than a random Thursday.
