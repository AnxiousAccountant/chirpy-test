paragraph1: Only two months after I tried the Czech's Budweiser the American Prohibition one, and like the UK courts I couldn't decided between the two. The recipe was crafted by the famous Anheuser Busch family during Prohibition in America during the 1920s and 1930s and was brought back in this form.
paragraph2: I was never a big "Bud" fan when I was a drinker, and no wonder the Americans hated prohibition as like the Czech one was not anything special.
paragraph3: Interestingly Budweiser Prohibition Brew was rebranded as Budweiser Zero.
