paragraph1: Picked this one up at the same time as the Doom Bar and tried it the day after and this one wasn't a surprise as it was a standard german taste.
paragraph2: Clausthaler pioneered an innovative method of brewing non-alcoholic beer by developing a process where only a negligible amount of alcohol is produced in the first place.
paragraph3: A nice refreshing beer but didn't set the world on fire but went down easily, not one I would go back to unless it was the only option.
