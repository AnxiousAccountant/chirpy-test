paragraph1: Beavertown are the official craft beer supplier to Tottenham but  they don't supply any non alcoholic beers as the only one available at the stadium is Heinken Zero
paragraph2: I got this IPA for my birthday and it had a fruity aroma when I poured and a nice fizzing sound coming out of the can. Unfortunately I am glad that its Heiniken Zero at the stadium.
paragraph3: This one lacked any real taste to me apart from a slight bitter after taste, which didn't live up to the name or the great design on the can.
