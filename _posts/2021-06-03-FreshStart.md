paragraph1: Another beer recommended to me. When I opened the bottle and poured the aroma of citrus fruits was strong and after the Tiny Rebel Tropica experience I was a little worried.
paragraph2: But after the first taste my worries evaporated, the flavour was crisp and fruity with a hint of bitterness, which went really well with the chilli and prawn pizza I was having for Dinner.
paragraph3: The downsides were I only brought the one bottle and HonestBrew & Thornbridge who teamed up to create ultra-low alcohol IPA only did so for a limited edition.
