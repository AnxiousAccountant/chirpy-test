paragraph1: My first holiday in almost 2 years and a new beer from the supermarket, the first one I tried was a bit warm so wasn't until the next day that I got to try a proper chilled one.
paragraph2: I was never a big stella fan when I used to drink and after the warm one the day before wasn't holding up much hope but it wasn't as bad as I thought slightly more bitter than I normally like but a nice taste and helped with the view of St Ives Bay.
paragraph3: However it wonâ€™t be a beer I rush back to but would take it over Becks Blue.
