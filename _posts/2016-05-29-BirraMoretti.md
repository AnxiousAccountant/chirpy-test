paragraph1: With the Drive behind me it was onto our first meal in Italy on the holiday and my first Italian non-alcoholic beer. This was the non-alcoholic beer I had been waiting for since San Miguel back in 2014.
paragraph2: This one had a softer taste than most of the other I had tried, and was very easy to drink as it was less gassy with some nice aromas.
paragraph3: It wasn't until 2019 that this beer made it to the UK and even though it is more expensive than some of the others in the UK it is worth it!
