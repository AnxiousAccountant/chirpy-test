paragraph1: So interesting Brew Dog originally brewed Nanny State at 1.1% ABV in 2011 as a backlash against the onslaught of mass media hysteria, consensual hallucination and the nailing of BrewDog to the mast which surrounded the launch of their 18.2% Tokyo ale.
paragraph2: Luckily I never tried the 18.2% one but they then rebrewed the nanny state from 1.1% to 0.5% in 2013 so could be defined as Alcohol free, but unfortunately for me this ale was a bit too bitter for my palate, but I have had it a number of times where it was the only one available.
