paragraph1: So a family trip to Ibiza in 2014 and one of the best non-alcoholic beers. I am not sure if the sun was a factor or that it tasted just like the real San Miguel but it was almost like the best beer I had tasted for such a long time, but my early relationship with San Miguel 0,0 was cut short after a week in Ibiza.
paragraph2: Another trip to Ibiza for my 10th Anniversary in the following year gave me another brief encounter to which I though would be my last but luckily on a trip to Tesco in the same year I noticed that it was being sold in the UK and since then it has become a more regular variety used in Pubs, and I am always happy when I ask "do you have any non-alcoholic beers?" and the response is "yes we have San Miguel 0,0"
