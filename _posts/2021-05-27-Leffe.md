paragraph1: The last time I had a Leffe beer didn't end well as I was at a Taste festival in Bath and mixed it with trying loads of different spirit tasters, loads of different foods and then a rail replacement bus home, lets just say it wasn't pretty.
paragraph2: I didn't pour this one well as I had a very large head and that meant initially a strong bitter taste but once I got through the head was a slight sweetness.
paragraph3: This was gassier than any beer I have had for a while. Overall a nice beer and went nicely with a pistachio little moon. The downside is that as the alcoholic versions of Leffe are on the strong side they only have 25cl bottles.
