paragraph1: So after visiting a supermarket in Ibiza I picked up this to try and it was very easy to drink as it was like a soft drink with the apple flavours along with the light malt notes. however it was very much a one off thing to try as a apple tango would give you the same result, so I quickly went back to its not fruity brother San Miguel 0,0 for the rest of the holiday.
