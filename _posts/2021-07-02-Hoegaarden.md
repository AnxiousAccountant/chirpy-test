paragraph1: So the first thing I noticed before I tried this one was the front of the can saying it was brewed with corinander seeds and orange peel. It poured with a nice head and with a what can only be discribed as a murky sunny colour.
paragraph2: I have never had the most distinguished palate and after 60 beers I don't think that will be changing. I couldn't tell you if there was corinander in there, the taste was pleasant with a slight bitterness on the end.
paragraph3: Interestingly only 8 of the 60 beers have had sugar added and 4 of those including this one are from Belgium and I think this beer would go down well with a nice belgium waffle and ice cream, a refreshing drink but is it a beer? And as I type this Belgium
