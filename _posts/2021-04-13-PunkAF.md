paragraph1: A sunny April evening pre dinner at our favourite places, Porthmeor Beach Cafe and a takeaway drink on the beach before we went for dinner. And at first I thought it was Brewdog's Nanny State so I was presently surprised it was the Punk AF.
paragraph2: I donâ€™t know if it was the view of the sun setting but I thought this one was nicer than the nanny state.
paragraph3: A refreshing taste and sweet taste which didn't have as much bitterness, and a good appetiser ahead of our meal.
