So for my first book review I thought it was only right to review the book that I had rewritten a chapter in a community book "The Bounce Back Journey of Men's Health" which was part of a trilogy of books where proceeds went to charity.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.discoveryourbounce.com/publishing/bounce-back-journey/" target="_blank">Click here to find our more</a>

Being a lover of numbers writing a chapter to go into a book was a totally new and different challenge for me, especially as sharing my thoughts had always been difficult.

Writing about my experiences helped me to become more open with sharing the way I am feeling, I still have a way to go on this but by sharing my experiences I hope it can help towards ending the stigma around mental health and inspire every to be more open about their feelings.

However this book has become more than that for me since reading the stories of the other 17 authors and and hearing the inspiring stories first hand at the book launch I felt really privileged that my story was in this book.

Each topic (including cancer, stroke, marriage breakdown, suicidal thoughts and abuse) within the book would be one that you wouldn't normally associate with the "Man up" culture that still dominates in the world.

I guarantee at least one of the stories (from any in the trilogy) will resonate with you and show people that things can get better after adversity.
