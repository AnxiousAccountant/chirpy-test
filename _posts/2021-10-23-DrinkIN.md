paragraph1: Another birthday gift, this one smelt the same as the Beavertown one I had just tried (I did use a new glass), but this one poured very yellowish with a nice head.
paragraph2: This one had a crisp but bitter taste which left a tangy gassy taste in my mouth but again no real flavour.
paragraph3: I do think this one would be nice in the summer to cool off if you didnâ€™t have any other drinks in the fridge.
