paragraph1: Another one on our drinks trolly I opened the can and the smell was of coffee and when I poured it was very dark in colour.
paragraph2: One mouthful was all I could manage and the taste was a cold strong bitter coffee and not a nice one at that!
paragraph3: So after over 50 beers the moment had come to make 0/10 for a beer.
