paragraph1: So the government's Eat out to help out scheme led me to another new beer. We booked an outside table at The Trout at Tadpole Bridge and the meal was really good but topped off by the FreeStar beer.
paragraph2: Interestingly FreeStar is made by an alcohol free process and that comes across in the taste which was nice and refreshing, with light citrus tastes giving way to the perle hops coming through as a savoury twist.
paragraph3: Another great thing about this beer is it the process for making emits 90% less CO2 than the industry average also with 80% less water and 70% less waste compared to the processes used in regular beer.
