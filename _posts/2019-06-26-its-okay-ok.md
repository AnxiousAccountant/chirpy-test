Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away after a weekend spent in bed with sickness and an upset stomach, which looks like it must have been something I ate as luckily nobody else in the family has come down with anything, so I took Monday off as I hadn’t really eaten anything.

So feeling slightly more human yesterday morning I thought it would be a good idea to go back to work but not only was I still physically fragile let’s just say a little more mentally fragile than I could deal with, so for the first time in ages I cried at work (in the toilets) and then on the bus on the way home (when my wife messaged asking if I was OK after I said I was going home) and then again when I finally got home after the hottest bus ride ever (maybe more in relief that anything)

So I keep myself busy working from home until lunch time and I have that hungry/nauseous feeling that you don’t know whether you are coming or going after you haven’t been feeling well, then eat some lunch, my stomach making some strange noises reminding me that my IBS hasn’t been out to play for a while, a quick walk and then home in time for another cry.

Back to work and getting deep into the fun that is accounting for the Variable Fee Approach under IFRS 17 with profits contracts and keeping in touch with colleagues through Skype messages and that was the afternoon done until the kids get back from their dentist appointment which fortunately it wasn’t at two thirty!

So on the work front a productive day and being in the lucky position that I can work from home helps, the distraction of work keeps the black dog at bay most of the time but it proves I still have a long way to go in my journey and I need to keep asking for help and I still find it hard to speak to people about my feelings, so writing them down is going to be a way of letting myself know it’s OKAY not to be OK and reminds me not to push myself too hard especially when I am not feeling physically well.

Working at home again today just put this up in my lunch break as I'm about to take a little walk around the village still feeling nauseous but on the plus side no tears as yet!
