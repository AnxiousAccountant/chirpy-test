paragraph1: So another Big Drop offering this time the only option available at Nandos and after the Galactic I almost ordered a bottomless sprite.
paragraph2: I am glad I didn't as this one had a nice colour, a nice smell and more importantly a nice taste.
paragraph3: It was light and had a good bitterness which helped was down the hot piri-piri sauce. Big Drop are forgiven for the milk stout!
