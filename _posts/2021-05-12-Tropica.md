paragraph1: Found this one on our drinks trolly I can't remember where it came from but was either my birthday or Christmas, I opened the can and the smell of Mango and pineapple was really strong as I poured.
paragraph2: But the taste was totally different to the smell, I couldn't get any of the tropical taste and a strong bitterness came through. It still left a bad taste in my mouth for a long time after I finished (even though I didn't finish the whole can)
paragraph3: According to Tiny Rell it tastes great poured over breakfast cereal, Lucky Charms are recommended.
