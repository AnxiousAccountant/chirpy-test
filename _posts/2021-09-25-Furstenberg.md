paragraph1: So this one had been sat in my fridge for a while and I had forgotten about it as it was hidden not sure how as it was a 500ml bottle, this one a pilsner from Germany's Black Forest poured pale yellow and very fizzy with the first taste a little too gassy and bitter for me.
paragraph2: But this one was a slow burner after it settled down it grew on me and the bitterness and gassiness drifted into the background and the last half went down a lot easier than the first half
paragraph3: With all the being said I would prefer a becks blue over this which means I won't be rushing back especially as I can't remember where I actually brought it from
