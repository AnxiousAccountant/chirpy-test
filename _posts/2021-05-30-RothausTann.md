paragraph1: This one was recommended to me. It had very little head when I poured and some light bubbles if I was doing a blind taste I would have said instantly this was a German beer.
paragraph2: A nice tasting beer which was more refreshing than I thought it would be after the bitterness of the first few sips as it went down very easily even though it left a strong after taste it was not an overly unpleasant one.
paragraph3: The strong taste probably comes from the original brewing of this beer being 14.5% ABV  before the alcohol is removed.
