paragraph1: I brought this one at the same time as I brought the Lazy AF but only got round to trying it a few weeks later, it is now sold out on the Brewdog website and isn't listed in their beers so not sure if it was only a limited edition.
paragraph2: The smell was really nice when I open the can and poured. It lived up to it's name being a very "hazy" beer I would call it Cloudy AF myself.
paragraph3: Unfortunately the taste didn't live up to the smell but still another nice beer from Brewdog.
