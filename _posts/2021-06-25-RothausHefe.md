paragraph1: My second Rothaus Alkoholfrei offering and this was was completely different to the Tannenzapfle. It poured with a large creamy looking head and a very cloudy appearance.
paragraph2: The taste matched the appearance it had a smooth creamy taste with a hint of bitterness which went down really well.
paragraph3: A totally different taste to what I am used to but another really nice beer from Rothaus!
