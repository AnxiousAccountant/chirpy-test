paragraph1: This was a chance purchase when my wife went to post a hermes parcel in random garage when we were out and about which she spotted in the reduced to clear. A sutle sweet smell when I poured and my wife stole the first sip and said this was nice and I would happily drink that.
paragraph2: This was nice and refreshing with a smooth not overly fizzy taste, and you can certainly taste the added sugar almost a toffee like taste. All in all a nice pale ale that went down well
paragraph3: I will be looking at trying to find the two other offerings (Smashed Larger and Smashed Citrus) from Drinks Unlimited as this one has certainly wet my appetite
