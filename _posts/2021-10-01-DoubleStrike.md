paragraph1: Another Brew Drop Brewing Company offering that didn't do it for me, I picked this one up from a garden centre along with a bottle of freestar.
paragraph2: The main taste I got from this one was vinegar and a fizzy one at that. There was a subtle cirtus flavour but not the lemon curd that was quoted on the bottle.
paragraph3: Now this beer was meant to be a great gateway into the world of sour beers but this one might put me off going there but I will try anything once!
