I'm Andy the Anxious Accountant.

I've not been an accountant all my life but in the last couple of years looking back being anxious has been a massive part of my 40 years on this planet.

Recently I have found that writing about my mental health has helped me with my recovery from the dark times that nearly costing me my life.

I had previously done this through social media but have found that by doing that I had fallen into the rabbit hole and was not helping as much as I wanted so I've set up this website to blog my mental health recovery and limit my social media usage.

Being an accountant one of my most used tools is Microsoft Excel so what better way to tell you about myself than using a spreadsheet, which also means I can update it with any questions you put in the comments.
