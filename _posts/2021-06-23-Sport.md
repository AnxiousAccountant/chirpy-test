paragraph1: A visit to Moreton-in-Marsh in the Cotswolds for some shopping for my wife's business and after not finding a parking space on the main street we went round to a car park and that meant we walked past the Moreton Beer Cellar which is where I found this beer.
paragraph2: It started well with a nice smell and crisp taste but as I got further into the bottle there was an increasing fizzy tang and the crisp taste was replaced by more bitterness.
paragraph3: I noticed after I finished that the beer was past it's best before date, not sure if that had any impact on the taste but won't be going back to the Belgium beer cellar to get this one!
