paragraph1: So after a number a couple of years drinking Becks Blue, I was in a wedding in Cornwall in May 2013 and asked the normal question "Do you have any non-alcoholic beers?" expecting the normal response "No sorry or yes Becks Blue ok?", to my shock the barmaid said "Yes we have a Holsten one!" In my shock I had to take a picture there and then and got said barmaid in the back ground and I do wonder if she thought I was crazy getting so excited over a drink!
paragraph2: As a kid I always wanted to try Holsten as they sponsored my favourite team for a number of years as a kid. Which kind of shows how advertising beers on football shirts isn't the best idea, along with betting companies and other things that kids shouldn't be interested in.
paragraph3: But back to the beer and I had found a different one to Becks Blue, it was a full flavoured beer and just tasting something different meant this at the time was the best beer I had ever drunk.
